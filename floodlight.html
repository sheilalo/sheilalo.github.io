			<h5 class="project-section-title">Background</h5>
				<p>The Floodlight MS smartphone app is an EU MDR-certified medical device that collects objective data on the function of patients with multiple sclerosis between clinic visits with their healthcare provider. While at Roche, I collaborated with the human factors and design teams to <strong>conduct summative and clinical validation studies</strong> for the Floodlight program. I also supported the <strong>EU MDR gap assessment and audit</strong> as part of the Regulatory team.</p>

			<h5 class="project-section-title">Validation Studies</h5>
				<p>Because of COVID-19, I remotely supported our on-site moderator in conducting <strong>1:1 simulated use testing with a set of representative participants</strong>. Then, I transcribed data to create a heat map of the users' performance on tasks to conduct a root cause analysis. In addition, I contributed to authoring the summative study reports and usability engineering files.</p>
