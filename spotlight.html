      <h1>Spotlight on Allergies <small>January 2017 - March 2017</small></h1>
      
        <h2>Overview</h2>

          <p>As part of DSGN 401-3: Human-Centered Service Design Studio, students collaborated with <a href="http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=17229" target="_blank">Dr. Ruchi Gupta</a>, a leading food allergy researcher at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, to <b>identify opportunities to improve the pre-orientation and orientation experiences</b> for college students with severe food allergies.</p>

          </div>

          <p>My team specifically focused on creating awareness of severe food allergies through partnerships with on-campus organizations and by supporting students as they transition from orientation into the first few weeks of college. We wanted to create a service that would be inclusive of students with allergies by bridging barrier of communication between students and campus organizations.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>To <b>understand user needs and benchmark existing support systems in place</b>, my group explored student dorms, shared kitchen spaces, and dining halls. We also interviewed dining hall staff to learn about current food accommodation and safety practices at Northwestern for students with allergies.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Through interviews with high school students, college students, and parents of students with severe food allergies, we learned about how they plan to or currently navigate the college experience. We were able to hear their thoughts on what support they wish they had or needed when they were transitioning to a new school. Finally, we also spoke with on-campus organizations to understand how they currently accommodate students with food allergies at events.</p>

          <p>Additionally, to experience using Epi-Pens, we learned how to use trainer pens and then later, real pens on oranges. It was my first time administering epinepherine and using a non-trainer Epi-Pen.</p>

          </div>

          <p>From user research, we <b>synthesized interviews</b> to create a <b>stakeholder map</b> and <b>journey map</b>. This led to a list of <b>insights</b> that allowed us to identify an <b>opportunity area</b>. Specifically, we identified the transition period between orientation and the first few weeks of school to be critical in supporting students with allergies as they meet new friends and classmates.</p>
       
          <p>Our goal was to create a campus program to <b>raise awareness about food allergies by partnering with university and student groups on campus</b>. Through this partnership, we would support catering for various events and severe food allergy awareness and education.</p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p>To understand the dynamics of partnering with a club, we <b>prototyped a mock event</b> held by Segal Design Institute and ordered food, created food labels, and taught everyone how to use Epi-Pens to understand the experience of working with a club to cater and educate club members. This mock event allowed us to refine communications materials that Spotlight would send to clubs.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-1"></div>
            <div class="col-md-5">

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">
              <div class="imgContainer">
                <a href="img/hires/spotlight_event2.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">
                  <img src="img/thumb/spotlight_event2.jpg" class="img-responsive contentImg">

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-1"></div>
          </div>

          <p>Later, we <b>iterated on our food label prototypes</b> to understand the best way to present allergen information. We tested students' mental models of food labels through a low-fidelity mock-up of an event in which they choose foods they can eat based off of randomly assigned allergies. We specifically tested for the accuracy in which they could identify the foods they could eat.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-1"></div>
          </div>

        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Based on feedback from user testing, we created <b>Spotlight Connect</b>, a service that <b>partners with on-campus organizations by supporting catering and anaphylaxis recognition</b>. Our goal with Spotlight Connect is to educate the student body about severe food allergies while giving students with allergies the confidence to attend events and explore new interests.</p>

          <p>We refined our <b>three main artifacts</b>: the email that Spotlight sends to clubs at the beginning of the school year, a list of suggested restaurants that can be modified for various allergies, and food labels that specify what allergens are in a certain dish. We also created a storyboard video to show how our service would improve the college experience for students with allergies.</p>

        <h2>Final Client Pitch</h2>
          <p>At the end of the ten week term, we <b>presented our service</b>, Spotlight Connect, to Dr. Gupta, her research team, Northwestern administration leadership, and individuals we interviewed. As a studio, after addressing different aspects of the pre-orientation and orientation transition processes to college, we came together to create Spotlight, an allergy awareness organization on campus that aimed to support college students with allergies.
