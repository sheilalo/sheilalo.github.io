      <h1>Room Buddy <small>October 2016 <br> Service Design</small></h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>As part of the Integrated Design Innovation (IDI) 24 Hour Challenge 2016, students from the University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Northwestern University, in collaboration with our partners from Penn Medicine, researched, designed, and prototyped ways to <b>improve the diagnosis, coping, and recovery process from Postoperative Cognitive Decline (POCD) and delirium</b> in older adult patients.</p>
          <p>How can we enlist caregivers to mitigate delirium/POCD or expedite recovery when the patient demonstrates symptoms of delirium/POCD post-surgery, in the hospital?</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>My group’s challenge was to <b>determine how to best support patients</b> who exhibit symptoms of delirium and their caregivers during the immediate post-operative period. We began with understanding the problem. Older patients are having surgeries at a greater rate today than ever before. As a result of the aging brain, anesthesia, and surgery, older patients are at higher risk of delirium. There is <b>currently little support in place</b> to prepare patients and caregivers for post-operative delirium.</p>

            </div>

        <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>We conducted secondary research based off interviews with neuro intensive care unit (ICU) nurses, interviews with patients who had delirium, and their caregivers in order to generate <b>questions for our guest panel</b>. The panel represented a range of interested stakeholders from doctors to former patients who provided firsthand accounts of dealing with delirium. We also <b>visited the neuro ICU</b> to better understand the spaces in which patients were recovering in as well as the spaces where caregivers stay during their family member’s surgery.</p>

            </div>

          <p>From there, we <b>synthesized our observations</b> and <b>developed key insights</b> into support system currently in place. Then, we found common themes based on our insights, which allowed us to begin <b>ideating potential solutions</b>.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                <p>Work in progress to design a solution</p>
            </div>

          <p>We decided to focus on ways to help rehabilitate patients who have delirium symptoms in the first few days post-operation. My group created several <b>low-fidelity prototypes</b> and received feedback from the perspective of doctors, experienced designers, as well as former patients and caregivers themselves.</p>

            </div>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
          <p>We created <b>Room Buddy</b>, a system that <b>leverages the current infrastructure of the room</b> to aid re-orientation while <b>promoting a sense of comfort and familiarity</b>. Patients and caregivers provide elements of the patient’s daily life prior to the surgery and those habits are translated into information on the television screen. The main screen will give the date, time, and weather to help patients re-orient with regards to time. A menu with achievements of major improvements, favorite television shows, favorite movies, and a family album allow patients to regain a sense of normalcy by helping reform their habits.</p>
