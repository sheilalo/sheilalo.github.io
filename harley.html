      <h1>Harley-Davidson <small>March 2017 - June 2017 <br> Strategy</small></h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>As part of DSGN 455: Design Strategy, my team was challenged by Harley-Davidson to identify new opportunities to engage new millennial riders, specifically around purchasing used motorcycles. Problem reframed, our goal was to <b>understand the emotional drivers behind millennials' values and their used buying habits</b> in order to provide Harley with a scalable strategy with multiple touchpoints that address <b>technical feasibility, stakeholder desirability, and business viability</b>.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>We first conducted <b>qualitative research</b> by interviewing <b>14 individuals</b> ranging from those who solely purchased used goods to those who purchased used Harleys. From these interviews, we were able to identify three pain points around the used buying process: value, trust, and labor. Millennials look to trust and value "experts" due to lack of experience in the time consuming used buying process.</p>

          <!-- Slide 12 -->

          <p>As part of our <b>quantitative research</b>, we conducted a survey with <b>750+ individuals</b> who bought and traded used computer products on an online forum. We learned that across income brackets, trade frequency remained constant. This showed that people are not necessarily buying used goods solely due to cost but rather to be part of a used purchasing community and experience of and accomplishment in scoring a good deal.</p>

          <!-- Slide 16 -->

        <h2>Frameworks</h2>
          <p>To communicate the tediousness of the current used buying process and what we hope to accomplish through our solution, we created two <b>frameworks</b>: a <b>journey map</b> and an <b>emotion map</b>. The current process requires high emotional investment and includes many possibilites of disappointment. We can improve the process by increasing motivation to buy the product earlier in the decision making process and reducing the amount of frustration in finding a suitable product.</p>

          <!-- Slide 27, 28, 29 -->

        <h2>Insight</h2>
          <p>Uncertainty around trust of either the seller or the product can lead to suffering exceeding buyers' motivation to buy used products. "Experts" can mitigate this difficulty, but they are unavailable to many.</p>

        <h2>Strategy Overview</h2>

             <p>Pitch video explaining our strategy's touchpoints</p>
          </div>

          <p>Our strategy is an ecosystem that consists of five main touchpoints: #FoundHarley, HDNA, REV Gallery, Bespoke Used, and Iron Cross Warranty. Through these touchpoints, we aimed to create an ecosystem that fostered trust and community amongst millenials who are non-riders, in particular, those without access to "experts." By simplifying and eliminiating pain points around the current used buying process, we create a sense of trust and safety around the future of used good purchases.</p>

        <h2>Final Pitch</h2>
          <p>At the conclusion of our ten week term, we pitched our solution to Harley's Innovation team and leadership. We presented our entire design process from user research to ideas about prototyping touchpoints. Additionally, for the solution as a whole and for each touchpoint, we presented an evaluation of feasibility, desirability, and viability. Our deck can be seen here.</p>
