                <p class="projectText col-sm-9">For Caltech’s E/ME/MedE 105: Design for Freedom from Disability class, my team conducted user/market research to design and prototype a modular one arm wheelchair drive attachment for individuals with hemiplegia. A user first rotates the footplate using their strong foot. This information is then translated into a desired position for the front caster wheel. We were named RESNA Student Design Competition Finalists and presented our project in Washington DC in July 2016.</p>

                <p class="projectText col-sm-9">My team was tasked to design an experience of feeling “relaxed” in the form of building a physical box. We decided to focus on four key sensory elements: soft and smooth surfaces, slow deep breaths, nature sounds, and “clean” scents. Our emotional box was fabricated from wood that was sanded down to create a smooth surface. LEDs slowly pulsed through an opaque acrylic windows that faded once the box was opened, releasing a “clean” scent and playing the sound of light waves.</p>

We were inspired by every day routines such as when water fills up, the pitch increases, which is an audible cue to turn off the faucet. Our final design taught users how to fill up their own bottle of water through a game of Simon Says. By whistling any three ascending notes, users were able to fill up their bottle.</p>
