			<h5 class="project-section-title">Background</h5>
				<p>As a Regulatory Affairs Specialist at Roche, I supported the <strong>design and development of 11 clinical decision support software products</strong> by creating international regulatory strategies in collaboration with product, engineering, design, quality, and compliance. I also authored, reviewed, and approved design history file documents including intended use statements, requirements, risk analyses, and instructions for use. I contributed to 4 releases in 2019, 31 releases in 2020, and 20 releases in 2021 for products currently launched in 22 countries.</p>
